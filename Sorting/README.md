# Description and Aim
**This repo aims to explore various vectorization and GPGPU approaches to popular sorting algorithm.**

## RESULTS - 
**Note that the time reported is only for the sorting algorithm to run and excludes time for populating and checking the sorted array**</br>
  Bubble Sort - </br>
* The test case was an array of size 1000000 populated with a random generator. 
* Time with vectorization - 1273.71 seconds(21.22 minutes)
* Vanilla BubbleSort - 2297.87 seconds(38.29 minutes)
* As it can be seen though the overall time is high we get a decent speed up
